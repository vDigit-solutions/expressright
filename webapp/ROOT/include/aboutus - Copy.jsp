							such as Technology, Robotics, Science, Fashion Design, Food prep, Politics and so many. 
							This is platform transform younger generation to leaders of the future.
							</p>
						
						<p>We have selectively tested training and testing modules for the Younger generation across ages.</p>
						<p>We would use two methodologies for this purpose:</p>
									<p>1. In-Person session - Capturing videos</p>
									<p>2. Virtual classroom training.</p>
							<p>We are focused on simplifying things for the kids making them fearless and confident speakers, 
							with a clarity in thought , encouraging them to enhance their niche skills 
							and upgrading the bar of their confidence and knowledge as an individual. 
							We believe in giving the kids enough time space and leverage to showcase their full potential. 
							We plan to help the kids realise their strength, as an individual and take 
							peer competition in public speaking to a level of a healthy competitive and friendly atmosphere 
							where they mutually act as an aid to help their peers to become confident public speakers.</p>

						<h3>Virtual meeting rooms:</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
						We have dedicated instructors who follow the similar methods and patterns as in our community groups of students.
						We strive continuously to reach out to all our students and participants through the latest virtual aids,
						keeping on par with  technology and education developments. Guiding all towards becoming a better public speaker and leader.
						We have interactive sessions based sessions here, which are properly planned and designed to maximise time utilisation. 
						We make an extra effort to give each individual who signs up with us virtually to choose from the time slots and 
						choose a different time slot if we they are unable to utilise the given slot due to various genuine reasons.
						This Program would vary for the different age groups focusing individually on each ones syllabus and needs as an age group to enhance their focal skills.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Aids:</h3>
						</p>
						<p>We would use different aids like:</p>
						<p>	1. Audio</p>
						<p>	2. Video</p> 
						<p>	3. Write-ups, News articles,</p>
						<p>	4. Story books reading and peer discussion, at an elementary level, choosing between, fiction, science</p>
						<p>	5. Grammar and writing specific  study materials</p>
						<p>	6. Encourage them to write blogs, make presentations to portray their skills and ideas</p>
						<p>	7. Word of the week</p>
						<p>	8. Topic of the week</p>
						<p>	9. Discussions</p>
						<p>	10. Debates</p>
						<p>	11. Speeches on various upcoming and age relevant  topics and society issues.</p>
						<p>	12. Storytelling and followed discussion on it based on the story line and the words used</p>

						<p>
						We at express right feel focal and soft skills should be made an attitude of an individual at a tender age, 
						so as to make them fully confident adults before they step into collages &  work place. 
						This gives them immense advantage to have a better understanding of their skills and 
						potential and their strength as an individual, making them a successful, student and leader, 
						giving them an opportunity to contribute to work and society at large. Also giving them an edge 
						to accommodate and  interact with anyone in the world very assertively.We do not believe in a classroom set up,
						we would only have continues interactive sessions, that are designed keeping in mind the attention span of 
						all the participants of the group. We strive in making the sessions very effective by keeping on par with 
						the continues changes in the teaching aids around the world and suitably adapting them into our sessions.

						<h3>Programs:</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
						<h4>-Elementary School</h4>
						</p>
						<p>We would have designed programs stressing on phonic sounds, pronunciations, how to focus on listening, 
						start public speaking and clarity in thought process, confidence in presentation, using different aids 
						for presenting yourself in front of audience, references to take for various topics, clarity in speaking.</p>
						<p><h4>--Middle School</h4></p>
						<p>Here we would like to use Communicative language teaching (CLT), or the communicative approach, 
						an approach to language teaching that emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of study.
						We want the kids to have the four way approach in our teaching and knowledge exchange </p>
						<p><h4>--Middle School</h4></p>
						<p>Here we would like to use Communicative language teaching (CLT), or the communicative approach, 
						an approach to language teaching that emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of study.</p>
						<p>We want the kids to have the four way approach in our teaching and knowledge exchange </p>
						<p>
						Essentially:</p>
						<p>The Focal Skill Approach<p>
						<p>The goal of the focal skill approach is studying in the SL in order to acquire it.
						This second language curriculum stresses the balanced development of listening, speaking,
						reading and writing by measuring competency in each skill and then focusing on the development of the weakest skill. 
						the same would be highly beneficial mode of  imparting listening, speaking, reading and writing skills effectively.
						</p>
						<p>Content-based Instruction</p>
						<p>Includes a theme of high interest to students and develops a wide range of language skills around that theme. 
						The learning of the content requires considerable exposure to a variety of forms of information. In the adjunct form 
						of cbi, language and content courses are taught separately but are carefully coordinated so that literacy, 
						oral language development and thinking skills are positively enhanced. In this approach, the content teacher 
						presents content to students while the language teacher brings vocabulary, grammar and sub skill development 
						to studentsâ€™ attention through typical exercises, all of which focus on the lexicon of the content. 
						Oxford (2001) describes approaches to CBI as above.<p>
						<p>Task-based Instruction</p>
						<p>Task-based instruction (TBI) uses tasks or stand-a-line activities which require comprehending, producing, 
						manipulating or interacting in the target language. The amount of listening, speaking, reading and writing 
						involved to complete the problem posed by the task is dictated by the task itself; however, most complex (multi step) 
						real-life tasks that take learners into the world outside the classroom will utilize all four skills. According to Nunan (1999).
						<p>Project-based approach</p>
						<p>This approach concretizes the integration of not only the four skills but also language, culture,experience and learning 
						strategies With the careful selection of a final project that requires learners to demonstrate what they have learned through 
						both oral and written production, the teacher plans backwards to identify what aspects of language, culture, experience and 
						learning strategies are required to complete the end project.</p>
						<p>
						<h4>High School:</h4>
						</p>
						
						<p>	For high school graduates we intend to focus on soft skills, social skills and interpersonal skills equally. 
						With this we would be able to accomplish on enhancing ability of an individual.	Ability may refer to touching 
						all the below given aspects of an individual's personality, making him an effective communicator and leader.
						Aptitude, a component of a competency to do a certain kind of work at a certain level Intelligence, logic, 
						abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, having emotional knowledge, 
						retaining, planning, and problem solving </p>
						<p>Knowledge, a familiarity with someone or something, which can include facts, information, descriptions, or skills
						Skill, the learned ability to carry out a task with pre-determined results
						Power (social and political), the ability to influence people or events
						Capability (disambiguation)
						Intellectual giftedness</p>
