						<p  text-align: justify; text-align-last:auto;>We have selectively tested training and testing modules for the Younger generation across ages.</p>
						<p  text-align: justify; text-align-last:auto;>We would use two methodologies for this purpose:</p>
									<p>1. In-Person session - Capturing videos.</p>
									<p>2. Virtual classroom training.</p>
						<p  text-align: justify; text-align-last:auto;>We are focused on simplifying things for the kids making them fearless and confident speakers, 
						with a clarity in thought , encouraging them to enhance their niche skills 
						and upgrading the bar of their confidence and knowledge as an individual.
						We believe in giving the kids enough time space and leverage to showcase their full potential. 
						We plan to help the kids realise their strength, as an individual and take
						peer competition in public speaking to a level of a healthy competitive and friendly atmosphere 
						where they mutually act as an aid to help their peers to become confident public speakers.</p>
